	<h1>The Chinese GPT2 Model</h1>

	<h3>Model description</h3>
	<p>This model is used to generate Chinese. <br/>I just upload the dataset. You can download the dataset on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackyuuup/littlegpt">kaggle</a>.<br/>The dataset has over 500 thousands dialogues in Chinese but this is still not a good dataset to train this model so it can be stronger if you have a larger dataset.</p>
	<p>I also have the code and you can try a small model on: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jackyuuup/littlegptmodel">The littleGPT2 model you can try.</a><br/>You can easily train a chat model by yourself if your computer have a GPU with more than <b>2GB VRAM.</b></p>
	<p>I trained a different model based on model <a href="https://huggingface.co/uer/gpt2-chinese-cluecorpussmall">gpt2-chinese-cluecorpussmall</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jackyuuup/littlegpt2">A larger model is there.</a><br/> You can train this model on your dataset if you have a GPU with more than <b>16GB VRAM.</b></p>
